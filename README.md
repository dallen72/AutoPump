# AutoPump

A mobile app I made using very little code, and unconventionally.

The app was simply a shortcut on my android phone which, when clicked, opened a local web page/html (index.html) file that directed to a github pages url with a workout for the day. I copied the index.html file from my linux machine to my Android device storage, and a third-party app was required to make the shortcut for the html file. Github pages was used for no-hassle, free hosting.

Python was used to generate the workout progression chart. If I forgot what weights I was doing for the excercises, I would at least remember what level I was at and would modify the url to go to the web page for that level to check what weight to do for the day.


The columns for the progression chart are:
1. Deadlift X20
2. Squat X20
3. x20 Row, x10Bench Row, Bench
4. DB Row/Bench x20
5. Incline Bench x10
6. Incline DB Bench x10
7. Military x10
8. DB Military x10
9. Push up
10. Pull up
11. 1 RPM Deadlift
12. 1 RPM Squat
13. 1 RPM Row
14. 1 RPM Bench
